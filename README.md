ofxCreditCardSwiper
============


This interfaces with a standard credit card swiper (we used this one - [http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=20-286-001](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=20-286-001) )

It will pull in the numbers from the card if you want to do custom processing - fairly readable code
